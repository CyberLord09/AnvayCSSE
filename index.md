## Background
-------------------------------------
My name is Anvay Vahia. I am 14 years old and have been living in San Diego my whole life. My parents are both from India, so this culture is a pretty big part of my life. Outside of school, I really enjoy tennis and the piano. I have been playing the piano since I was 8 or 9 years old. On the other hand, I started tennis only around 2 years ago, but I am really enjoying it. I also participate in this competition called CyberPatriot. This competition is what inspired me to join CSSE. Some of my hobbies include video games, biking, and going go-karting. I also like spending time with friends when I have the time to do so.
